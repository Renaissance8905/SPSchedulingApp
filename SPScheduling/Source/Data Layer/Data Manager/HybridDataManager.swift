// In most cases, this is the Data Manager that will actually be used
// It fetches/stores no data directly, but rather curates interaction
// between local and remote Data Managers.
//
// The general pattern for this is:
//
//  1)  Check the local manager for non-stale data
//  2a) If present, return local data
//  2b) Else if needed, ask the remote manager for fresh data
//  3)  Give the results to the local manager for storage
//  4)  Return results to the consumer
